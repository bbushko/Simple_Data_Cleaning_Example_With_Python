# Simple_Data_Cleaning_Example_With_Python
In this based on one of Codecademy's challenges I will show you how to make
a simple cleaning of a dataset, using loops and operations with strings. 
There you can see in worksuch methods as: .replace(), format(), split(), strip() etc.

This code can be a good example of cleaning data with 'vanilla' python for novice data analytics:
at the first stage you will see the initial database condition (which is pretty bad, actually),
and then you will see how an analytic can improve readability of such databases, using vanilla python methods.
